			<h2>The Ultimate Debate</h2>

				<h3>Why Cats are Superior</h3>
						<p>When comparing cats and dogs, I believe the choice is quite clear what animal is the best. Dogs are smelly. All they do is eat, poop, and LIE. Cats have never done anything wrong. The live for the compassion of their human counter-parts. Since I was 7, I have had a dog. Her name is sparky and she is still alive to this day. Some days, mondays in partiular, sparky is dumber than a sack of potatoes. Quite often I will find her sleepig all day! Cats don't do that. The live for adventure. I see cats roaming the streets, finding things to hunt. I can not tell you how many times I've fed my dog! Sometimes I wish I could just let sparky do the same... but then I remember, today is monday.</p>

				<h3>Why Dogs are the Best Animal</h3>
					<p>Comparing what my partner Mackenzie said I completly disagree with everything this man said. He is stinky for thinking my favourite animal is stinky, Dogs are wonderful creatures and deserve the praise of everyone. I think dogs are cool and better than cats because for hundreds if not thousand of years they were by our side helping us do tasks to help us live, such as hunting or herding animals. I do however agree with Mackenzies point that they need to be fed, but I think that is a issue that I am willing to comprimize on, because dogs are awesome. </p>
