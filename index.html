				<h3>Why Dogs are the Best Animal</h3>
					<p>Comparing what my partner Mackenzie said I completly disagree with everything this man said. He is stinky for thinking my favourite animal is stinky, Dogs are wonderful creatures and deserve the praise of everyone. I think dogs are cool and better than cats because for hundreds if not thousand of years they were by our side helping us do tasks to help us live, such as hunting or herding animals. I do however agree with Mackenzies point that they need to be fed, but I think that is a issue that I am willing to comprimize on, because dogs are awesome. </p>
